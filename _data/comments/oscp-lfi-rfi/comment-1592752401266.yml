message: "Emerald developer celebrates bulk store win, but many others are not\n\nCedar Rapids, IA â€” The retail giant Golden Ears Mall unveiled plans to build a bulk store that could become Cedar Rapids' largest in the world at 5,400 square feet. Located at the west end of the mall, the planned store will have up to 70,000 square feet of space and would include a restaurant, a specialty food store, an extensive guest lounge, a fitness center, a beer garden and a \"bundling store\". The facility will be developed using mixed-use development and would feature a hotel, community centers, sports courts and a mall-style retail plaza.\n\nGolden Ears, which is owned by a team of local developers, also released an ambitious project that is expected to be the largest in Texas with plans to open a 7.7-acre campus to serve as a training center for its employees, as well as a retail complex and more space for its businesses.\n\n\"We have high standards that we expect in every project and that's what we're aiming to achieve here,\" said Stephen Reinsch, president and CEO of Golden Ears Mall. \"We've seen it over the last few years. That's why we put our heart and soul into this project and we want to remain on the fast track to that goal. It's an unbelievable effort on both ends of the project, to me.\"\n\nReinsch and his team also intend to spend $50 million on new commercial space, adding an additional 1.3 acres on the southwest side of the mall to accommodate its 5,400 square foot complex.\n\nGolden Ears also plans to add a $40 million roof and a restaurant in addition to additional retail space at the plaza to serve its clients, who would be served by two full sized restaurants and one cafe.\n\nGolden Ears was started by the owners in 2001 and was named \"Outstanding Center for Health and Development\" in 2004 by the American Hospital Association.\n\nReinsch said the Cedar Rapids development will help the mall, which was listed for sale earlier this year, attract and retain more of its employees and businesses over the years.\n\n\"I'm pleased to report the company has taken serious action in terms of its financial plans,\" Reinsch said. \"We made a significant financial commitment in order to open the new complex, but we had to take a little time to do so. The overall goal is to be competitive to attract talent to the Cedar Rapids area.\"\n\nA new $100 million Cedar Rapids Mall, expected to open by late 2018, will become one of the largest in the United States after Golden Ears.

Their conditions did not reflect further injuries.\n\nA witness, Bill Follner, said he heard a loud boom and then a woman calling her daughter \"Mommy, why are you looking at me?\"\n\nThe man who took the woman into custody said he saw the trunk open and then the man came out of the car, putting the child out, he said. The woman took off, Follner said.\n\nHe heard another car driving up beside him just after that and he saw a white pickup truck driving towards them.\n\nThe car was headed back to the driveway when the front end came up, he said.\n\nThe pickup turned onto the southbound lanes of the Rte 2300 and rolled over. The front ended hit a curb and the rear ended on a house, Follner said.\n\nIn addition to its windows broken, the vehicle was soaked to the touch with water, he said.\n\nThe engine was still running.\n\nTwo people were involved in the accident and their condition was not known. The driver was described as a 20-year-old man who was wearing a \"blaze blue\" sweatshirt and gray sweatpants and had a black hat, said police spokeswoman Janice Bussing.\n\nThe woman was described as a 27-year-old man who had short, dark hair and was wearing a red shirt and black sneakers.\n\nThe family of one of the women was being questioned on Monday by police, Bussing said. The names of the other two victims are being withheld as a precaution, she said.\n\nThe river had been near its highest level since Sept. 9.\n\nThe flooding on the river is unprecedented in some time, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA similar incident involving a woman sank the car of two men at a Walgreens in South Burlington.\n\nThe woman's family said they didn't know the car's owner or what caused the accident."

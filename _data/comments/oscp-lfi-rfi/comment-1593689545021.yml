message: "Many below poverty line in wa welfare group\n\n\nIf you aren't getting benefits because you don't pay taxes, you should be in the welfare group with those who are. You aren't.\n\nThe government is trying to pretend that working poor people have a different social life than rich people - so it's a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nThe welfare-to-work scheme that Labour are planning as its new programme, which it says could provide at least 700,000 jobs each year, won't even let people join the benefits without paying tax. It won't even let the self-employed join without tax. It won't even give people who have had their benefits cut and will only allow them to access them for 30 days, instead of 60 - a time when many people who qualify to access benefits need more.\n\nThe government has repeatedly said that the main goal is to provide a better society. It's making sure the poor can still go to school. But it's failing to do a whole lot to help the poor who have had their welfare cuts cut to such an extent that it doesn't even have the means to help them get to school.\n\nThe government will have to pay a big price for this failing of its own. Labour will have to pay a huge price. As I say, as many as 700,000 jobs a year could be created because more people would get the education and training they need to gain the skills they want to have. If there was only one Labour Party in our country, its supporters would be shouting for David Cameron to quit to allow these workers to work for the benefit they deserve.\n\nThere's also a chance that Labour's welfare-to-work programme could have a lot to do with the government's welfare cuts. It should be no surprise that Mr Cameron would like to reduce the amount of public spending from the taxpayer's pocket to the benefit of the poor - to pay down the debts that are piling up, or reduce tax credits so more people can get work.\n\nIf Mr Cameron wants to get more money from the Treasury he should say so. He should take account of the evidence from the OECD and the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggests that even a small increase in public spending could increase poverty and make things better for the poor. When those who don't benefit from government largesse can go and start to enjoy better lives, then we don't want them to be deprived of that chance.\n\nThe government may want to talk to the public but they probably don't want to talk to the Tories. If, at the next election, he wants a government that doesn't run off with public funds but can spend them in the way that benefits and working poverty need, he should say so so as well.\n\nThe last Labour government tried t \r\n<a href=https://www.onikssport.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>바카라</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.grupo-huk.com/>바카라</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.thesilkwrap.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.cashmudra.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n \r\nBreeding cows go to slaughter as drought sees properties run dry\n\nThe Government's decision to ban the export of beef from Australia, in a move hailed by the UN and animal welfare groups, puts the cattle trade at risk of a second major cull as the drought across western Australia worsens.\n\nThe moratorium is expected to take effect as early as April and has already sparked anger across Australia, with people rallying to animal charities to support them and urging people who do not follow the cow meat industry to reconsider their purchase.\n\n\"I'm fed up of hearing about animals dying out,\" one angry customer told Guardian Australia. \"I don't want my beef sold. It's a bad choice.\"\n\nThe Queensland Government announced it was cutting its exports, saying that while prices were rising, supply was rising and no longer meeting the industry's demand.\n\n\"We are working diligently with our export partners to ensure that the domestic market is secure and efficient and Australia's dairy sector is strong and able to meet its customers' dietary requirements,\" the Queensland government said in a statement. \"While there is currently significant uncertainty around the future of international supply through the import of beef from Australia, the Government recognises and supports domestic demand to reduce the risk of a cull.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Environment said there had \"never been a proposal to restrict the export of Australian beef\" and the department had not ruled out such a move: \"At this time, the only thing the department has received is the threat of a cull and while the government is not prepared to ban any beef, it is clear that beef consumption is increasing globally.\"\n\nBureau of Meteorology data showing the nation's dry winter weather has led to an increase in the number of cattle in slaughterhouses, but the vast majority of the farms operating are located in the west â€“ in NSW, the number of cattle in the industry hit more than 7,000. The number in the south has been declining, according to the government's figures.\n\nBrazier and other cattle farmers were particularly struck by the ban.\n\n\"The government has no excuse to pull the rug from under them,\" said Mike Wilson, the industry's chief executive. \"We've always been extremely optimistic about the future of the industry. This could have been a great opportunity to bring some confidence back to the industry and to support the business. The industry needs an opportunity to prove itself to be a viable entity.\"\n\nâ€¢ This article was amended on 26 March 2014 to correct the state of the supply of Australian cattle."

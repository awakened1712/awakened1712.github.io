message: "Whistleblower attacked after outing neurosurgeon's corruption\n\nA neurosurgeon at UCLA was ordered to resign for allegations he used his university physician-client relationships for his own benefit and that he abused his position to help fund his private lifestyle.\n\nDr. Stephen L. Yoder, an internal medicine physician at the University of California, said in sworn testimony that he paid about $2.6 million to Dr. James Altberg, the family physician at UCLA Medical Center. Langer's financial disclosures show Langer paid about $500,000 for a golf retreat at the beachside home of Langer's former wife, who also worked for Langer. A neighbor of Langer testified in the trial that he and his wife attended the retreat together and that Dr. Langer, who had served as the hospital's deputy physician for internal medicine, regularly called the area home.\n\nLanger's attorney, Christopher Langel, said his client did little to stop the scandal. \"I understand that this was an awful situation,\" he said. \"But this is about a very simple question: Who benefited from Dr. Langer's behavior?\" \r\nï»¿<a href=https://www.prakritikolkata.com/>더킹카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n \r\nTimmins fined following practical joke\n\nTimmins and his teammates at the beginning of this year's World Cup were in London to help prepare for the tournament. The story that broke in the English press last week was about how the team was fined Â£40,000 (US$74,000) in compensation for giving the joke and also the players were fined for being \"embarrassed,\" according to media reports.\n\nThe comments were made by Timmins during an interview to the New York Times Magazine and there were suggestions that Timmins was angry over the fact that the team would not be given a full stadium, or even a full locker room.\n\nDuring his interview, he was quoted as saying: \"They were like, 'We want to go back to your hotel room and stay there!'\"\n\nHe continued: \"People are going, 'But that's a bad joke.' But it's not like they were doing anything inappropriate. It's just that they were not paid enough for the $40,000. What's the problem there? Is it a joke? Or is it just a business problem? Or does the fact that they said no to our hotel room just make it seem like you are taking money out of your hotel room? I don't really know how to explain this.\"\n\nIt appears that his team actually paid them, he said.\n\nNo explanation available on the team's financial situation\n\nIn an email obtained by SoccerWire, the U.S. Soccer Federation said it received only a single complaint from a fan about the joke at the 2010 World Cup, but admitted that it is still looking into the matter.\n\n\"We receive allegations all the time,\" the email states. \"So this is very important that we fully investigate this, but we are also mindful that we have not heard any other reports in the media about this at this time.\"\n\nU.S. Soccer later apologized on the internet, while the U.S. Soccer Federation was quick to claim that \"this is a serious matter.\" The U.S. Soccer statement is below.\n\nU.S. Soccer did hear one complaint about the 2010 World Cup joke. When asked about that complaint, U.S. Soccer said we are still investigating it.\n\nThe U.S. Soccer statement follows below:\n\n\"This type of behavior from some national team players at international matches has no place in the soccer community, especially when we consider the national teams' financial situation. We have worked hard over the past few years to protect our players and pay them the way they deserve and that includes paying them the appropriate amounts for international games.\n\n\"It is not only inappropriate, it also does not reflect the integrity of our national teams or the commitment w"

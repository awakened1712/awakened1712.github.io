message: "Canberra construction company geocon charged breach consumer law on mortgage payments\n\nUpdated\n\nA $40 million engineering contract awarded by a private Australian engineering firm to the Victorian Government has emerged as a breach of consumer laws, Labor has told the Victorian Government.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, Attorney-General Steven Miles asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission to investigate the $40 million deal with Geocon, a US construction firm contracted by the Victorian government.\n\nGeocon is a joint venture between Geico and a company with overseas operations, VTE Architects and Management.\n\nGeocon said it is committed to being a responsible client, having previously agreed to set a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 12 per cent for its construction work on Victoria's public infrastructure.\n\nAs part of the contract, the Victorian Government has committed to pay Geocon $15 million in interest over the next three years.\n\nThe $40 million contract was awarded to VTE in 2011 for five projects in western and northern Australia.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, Mr Miles said the Victorian Government's investigation was the \"first step\" in establishing whether any law has been breached.\n\n\"That includes whether Geocon has done anything within the law that would prevent the Victorian Government from carrying out its oversight duties of ensuring that a contract or agreement reached with them meets the Australian Consumer Law,\" he said.\n\nMr Miles said he did not know why the state's laws were breached, but said he would welcome recommendations from the commission from next Tuesday.\n\n\"I urge the Victorian Government to conduct an independent investigation into the breach and hold senior executives accountable,\" he said.\n\nTopics: law-crime-and-justice, government-and-politics, community-and-society, public-sector, business-economics-and-finance, consumer-protection, australia\n\nFirst posted \r\nï»¿<a href=https://www.prakritikolkata.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n \r\nCanberra hospital set to get accreditation for clinical care\n\nAn internal hospital report has revealed the potential impact of funding cuts on Canberra's clinical infrastructure.\n\nThe report by the Hospital Integrity Unit (HUI) found hospitals could be forced to cut costs through outsourcing the care of patients.\n\nThe hospital is set to gain accreditation to offer patient care through the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme.\n\nThe report also reveals the potential impact of funding cuts on the infrastructure of Canberra Hospital.\n\nA report of the HUI report was released today at the Canberra hospital.\n\nThe hospital was ordered into administration after three years of underfunding by Canberra City Council.\n\nThe council received over A$200 million (US$195 million) in taxpayer funding, but the Hospital Integrity Unit was ordered to investigate whether Canberra Hospital had breached the public trust Act or had failed to comply with its obligations as an Australian health unit.\n\nThis resulted in the HUI finding that the institution's financial health was in danger.\n\nIn the report, the Hospital Integrity Unit identified a number of areas where patient care was affected and recommended action to improve the quality of patient care and improve outcomes for patients.\n\nThe report noted patients were often unaware of care available to them.\n\nThe HUI said staff were sometimes at risk of having medical equipment broken or misused.\n\nHowever, the report said the Hospital Integrity Unit had not yet identified any evidence of this being the case.\n\nIn the interim, the HUI recommended that Canberra hospital implement new measures to improve its quality of care.\n\nThe report recommended that Canberra hospital increase services and address the health service funding gap to provide services to a \"better community\".\n\nFor now, the HUI recommended that, \"despite the need for funding, and despite the need for increased patient and public health care, the hospital should continue to provide the best patient and public health care possible at a cost level comparable to comparable services in other Australia-wide health and social care institutions\".\n\nThe report concluded the hospital should seek federal funding to enhance its ability to provide patient care and implement the recommendations.\n\nHospital has until December 2 to respond.\n\nACT chief executive Michael Rakell said the results of the report were \"encouraging\".\n\nHe said it called for Canberra to find a way to deliver better patient care.\n\n\"The Government is also fully supportive of any recommendations that may be sought to improve our patient care. For example, as it applies to Canberra we need to increase the services that we provide, reduce costs in our existing network and implement the recommendations of the HUI report for patient care which the Government has stated is in the interests of the hospital.\"\n\nThe Health Minister, Joe Hockey \r\n<a href=https://www.onikssport.com/>온라인카지노</a>"

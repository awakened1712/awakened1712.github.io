message: "Mulloway minister, who told the BBC he was \"absolutely\" not satisfied, said that the EU could now find it was having difficulty dealing with \"fiscal and regulatory uncertainty\".\n\n\"We're not going to be the first country in the eurozone to experience a financial crisis,\" he said. \"We're going to be the first country to see what it's like to not be able to make payments. The ECB can't simply say: 'We'll just do this, we'll do that.' It's absolutely wrong.\"\n\nMr Varoufakis said he accepted that the Greek debt owed by banks was a \"travesty\" and he acknowledged that that debt was unsustainable, despite \"huge international support\".\n\n\"But it is a travesty that the whole idea of bailouts is to do with debt and to use money to bail out these countries,\" he said. \"That's where the danger lies, it's that all these loans are just for bailouts, for borrowing money and creating a bail out by the International Monetary Fund.\"\n\nMr Varoufakis added that Greece had the right \"sooner or later\" to accept responsibility for its debt and called on Greek MPs to demand that their country borrow money before imposing further austerity measures. \r\n<a href=https://www.uzgitwebtasarim.com/>바카라사이트</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>바카라사이트</a>\r\n \r\nDisease claims 60 lives after indian floods\n\nDalit farmer Gaurav Ghosh died on Saturday evening, the Indian Express reported, in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan.\n\n\nThe 40-year-old farmer died in his fields near Gwalior after inhaling toxic fumes of his field as he was going for a shower.\n\n\nThe death is the latest to hit the rural population, after a spate of accidents involving local officials, farmers and other people.\n\n\nRajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who had earlier declared an emergency, declared state of emergency on February 13th in the state and asked all civil servants to do all they can to avert further incidents.\n\n\nRaje had urged farmers in the state to immediately move out of the affected areas, which will be closed for three weeks. It came amid fears that local officials could not afford to compensate the affected farmers.\n\n\nGurgaon district chief commissioner Sushil Bihari said on February 15th that the government had asked people to move out of all affected areas.\n\n\nSushil Bihari had said farmers were being told that the flood could affect their crops, which he suggested they move out of as the farm is surrounded by houses.\n\n\nOn February 16, villagers of Gwalior district said they were being told their lands had been given to them to build houses, but they did not move the lands and were being forced to evacuate.\n\n\nThe residents of several villages, including some with 300,000 people, had already given up their agricultural fields.\n\n\nRajeshwari Raj in Bhojpur said that the families, which had gathered near his office, were told that they had no choice but to move to towns or the countryside.\n\n\nLocal authorities refused to offer compensation, and farmers said they were told the houses would be rebuilt or destroyed.\n\n\nSome locals also complained about the noise of construction workers, who were allegedly not allowed to enter the affected areas."

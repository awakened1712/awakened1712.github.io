message: "Trescowthick facing corporate charges for a $7 million water-cleaning scam. He was caught in a massive corporate fraud and he was busted. (CBC)\n\nThe investigation is ongoing in connection with the recent $6 million fraud by one of the country's largest water companies, TransCanada Corp., involving the $7.1-million contract to clean a hydroelectric dam in Thunder Bay, Ont.\n\nTrescowthick and his business partner, a well-known Edmonton financier, did not pay taxes on the contract and used the proceeds to buy a house on an affluent residential property.\n\n\"We were told to pay at least $2.4 million in taxes, which is $2.4 million, and it was very unclear what it meant,\" said Terry McAllister, the executive director of the Ontario Anti-Fraud Authority. \"But it certainly doesn't make sense from the point of view of taxpayers.\"\n\nIn a news release, the Ontario government said its investigation identified the allegations against Trescowthick, and that he is cooperating fully with authorities.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, TransCanada spokesman Tom McMurray declined to comment beyond the announcement of the investigation.\n\nAs recently as April, one of Trescowthick's company partners told reporters there was a \"muddle of information\" at hand, and that the company was \"surprised\" with the news.\n\nTrescowthick was recently placed on paid leave after being charged in a major corporate fraud investigation â€” part of a probe that revealed massive corporate fraud for years involving a Calgary-based company. (Cameron McConnell/CBC)\n\nHe said there is \"no doubt\" the company did not pay taxes when making payments to him and his partners.\n\nHe said his company's tax adviser was also on leave.\n\nTrescowthick denied any wrongdoing in the case.\n\n\"The truth is the fact is the only way I can make a living, I work as hard as I can for the government,\" he said, adding that he will continue his legal case against TransCanada and to the authorities.\n\nTrescowthick was also interviewed on a commercial television program two years ago and was told he had to make payments to cover the tax losses from one of the most dramatic years in his career.\n\nHe was then charged with fraud after several cases were closed in connection with that scheme.\n\nHe agreed to a deal for $20 million to settle the criminal case, which was inked in 2011.\n\nTrescowthick said he has worked for TransCanada since 2001 and was on top of his business. \r\n<a href=https://www.khangheshlaghi.com/>카지노</a>\r\n \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.onikssport.com/>카지노사이트</a>"
